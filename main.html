                    The air we breathe contains many different contaminants that can adversely affect our health. Some
                    of them are instantly dangerous, others cause damage gradually, sometimes over decades. Knowing the
                    dangers of the air we breathe can help prevent serious illness and sometimes sudden death.

                <p>
                    Hazardous and harmful substances contained in the inhaled air can be in a solid, liquid or gaseous
                    state. They may have different maximum permissible concentrations, depending on external conditions,
                    the nature of physical activity, exposure time, etc. Some of them cannot be detected without the
                    help of special instruments. There are substances that pose a toxic, carcinogenic or biological
                    hazard even in low concentrations. In some cases, you have to deal with a combination of various
                    dangerous substances that require comprehensive respiratory protection.

                <p>
                    The correct selection of the appropriate personal respiratory protection equipment can only be
                    carried out by specialists, based on accurate data on the state of the air environment. Different
                    respirators provide protection against specific contaminants, the composition and concentration of
                    which is a key determinant of the type of PPE used. In addition to taking into account the
                    protective properties of the respirator, it is required to evaluate its size, compatibility with
                    other elements of individual protection, as well as the fit to the user's face. It is required to
                    carefully study the instructions of the PPE manufacturer and take into account all requirements for
                    its fitting, use, as well as the rules for storage and disposal.
